WittyWhale is a lighthearted desktop application built with Python that uses a Tkinter interface to deliver and review jokes. It integrates with the JokeAPI to fetch and display random jokes for the user at the click of a button. In addition to receiving jokes, users can contribute their own by typing them into the interface, where the app provides feedback or a playful “review” of their submission, creating an interactive and fun experience that combines humor with user participation.
